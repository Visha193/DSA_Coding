In Computer programming, loops are used to repeat a block of code.

- In Java 
Three Types Of Loops :

1. for loop
2. while loop
3. do while

for loop: 
--------------

for loop is used to run a block of code in a certain number of times.

Syntax: 

for(initialExpression; testExpression; updateExpression)
{
    //(body of loop)
}

- initialExpression -> Declaring variables/Executed once
- testExpression -> Condition is evaluated. If condition is true.
- updateExpression -> Update the value of initial expression.

while loop:
--------------

while loop is used to run a block of code, when the number of iterations is unknown. 

Syntax:

initialExpression;
while(testExpression)
{
    [              ]
    updateExpression
}

Do while loop:
--------------

Do while loop is used to run a block of code, when the number of iterations is unknown. 

Execution once before the test condition is checked.

Syntax:

do
{
    [               ]
    updateExpression
}while(testExpression);
